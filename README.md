# Carla-ObjectDetction-datagenetation

This code stores the carla simulation data from different sensors and bounding box different vehicles. This data can be used train/test the multi model object detction models.

Features of the project:

- [x] This code supports CARLA 0.8.13.

- [x] Logs the data from Radar, LiDAR, Depth camera and RGB camera

- [x] Stores data in multiple weather and map conditions.

- [x] 3D bounding boxes

- [x] Refer the sample video to see the demo of the generated data.
